    title: "Weight Control - Emphasizing Elements",
    content: `**Weight control allows you to emphasize or de-emphasize specific elements in your prompt.**

### Basic Syntax
- \`(element:1.5)\` - Increases emphasis by 50%
- \`(element:0.5)\` - Decreases emphasis by 50%
- \`(element:1.2)\` - Slight increase by 20%
- \`[element]\` - Alternative de-emphasis syntax

### Examples
\`\`\`
(beautiful eyes:1.3), detailed portrait
(dark background:0.7), bright subject
((very important:1.5)) - Double parentheses also work
\`\`\`

### Best Practices
- Keep weights between 0.5 and 1.5 for best results
- Use sparingly - too many weights can confuse the model
- Higher weights don't always mean better results
- Test different weight values to find the sweet spot

    title: "Mixing Concepts - Blending Elements",
    content: `**Create unique images by blending multiple concepts together using special syntax.**

### AND Syntax
- \`concept1 AND concept2\` - Equal blend of two concepts
- \`concept1:0.7 AND concept2:0.3\` - Weighted blend

### Examples
\`\`\`
cat AND robot - Creates a robotic cat
forest:0.6 AND ocean:0.4 - Forest with ocean elements
warrior AND angel AND demon - Three-way concept mix
\`\`\`

### Advanced Mixing
\`\`\`
[cat|dog|bird] - Alternates between concepts
[cat:dog:0.5] - Transitions from cat to dog at step 0.5
{2$$cat|dog} - 2 cats and 1 dog composition
\`\`\`

### Tips
- Balance is key - equal weights often work best initially
- Some concepts blend better than others
- Use with style mixing for unique results
- Experiment with transition timing

    title: "Attention Brackets - Fine Control",
    content: `**Use brackets and parentheses for precise attention control in your prompts.**

### Bracket Types
- \`(text)\` - Increases attention by 1.1x
- \`((text))\` - Increases attention by 1.21x (1.1 * 1.1)
- \`[text]\` - Decreases attention by 0.9x
- \`[[text]]\` - Decreases attention by 0.81x

### Nesting Examples
\`\`\`
(masterpiece, (best quality:1.2))
[background, [crowd:0.8]]
((extremely detailed eyes:1.3))
\`\`\`

### Advanced Usage
\`\`\`
\\(literal parentheses\\) - Escape with backslash
{alternate|syntax|options} - Some UIs use curly braces
<lora:name:0.8> - LoRA syntax uses angle brackets
\`\`\`

### Platform Differences
- **Automatic1111**: Full bracket support
- **ComfyUI**: May require specific nodes
- **InvokeAI**: Different syntax variations
- **Midjourney**: Limited bracket support

    title: "Step Control - Prompt Scheduling",
    content: `**Control when elements appear or disappear during the generation process.**

### Basic Scheduling
- \`[prompt:0.5]\` - Starts at 50% of steps
- \`[prompt::0.5]\` - Stops at 50% of steps
- \`[from:to:0.5]\` - Switches from one to another

### Examples
\`\`\`
[forest:0.3] - Forest appears after 30% completion
[crowded::0.7] - Crowd disappears at 70%
[day:night:0.5] - Transitions from day to night
[cat:dog:0.3] - Cat for 30%, then dog
\`\`\`

### Advanced Scheduling
\`\`\`
[prompt:10] - Starts at step 10 (absolute)
[prompt::25] - Stops at step 25 (absolute)
[[prompt]::0.5] - Combines with de-emphasis
\`\`\`

### Use Cases
- Add details progressively
- Remove unwanted elements mid-generation
- Create transformations or morphing effects
- Fine-tune composition development

### SDXL Resolution
- Recommended: 1024x1024 base resolution
- Aspect ratios: 1:1, 9:16, 16:9, 2:3, 3:2
- Higher resolutions possible with proper settings

### SDXL Prompt Structure
\`\`\`

Secondary prompt: Overall style, mood, quality

Example:
Prompt: woman in red dress, garden, sunset
Style prompt: cinematic, professional photography
\`\`\`

### SDXL Refiner
\`\`\`
Base model: 0-80% of steps
Refiner model: 80-100% of steps
Switch at: 0.8 strength typically
\`\`\`

### SDXL Specific Tags
\`\`\`
score_9, score_8_up, score_7_up, // Quality scores
source_anime, source_cartoon, // Source material
rating_safe, rating_questionable, // Content rating

    title: "Model Trigger Words",
    content: `**Many models and LoRAs require specific trigger words to activate their training.**

### Understanding Triggers
- Required words that activate model features
- Usually found in model documentation
- Case-sensitive in some models
- Position in prompt can matter

### Common Trigger Examples
\`\`\`
// Style LoRAs
"in the style of [artist]"
"artwork by [name]"
"[style] style"

// Character LoRAs
"[character name]"
"[outfit description]"
"[characteristic features]"

// Concept LoRAs
"[object name]"
"[specific pose]"
"[action word]"
\`\`\`

### Finding Triggers
1. Check model card on Civitai/HuggingFace
2. Look for "trigger words" or "activation tokens"
3. Review example prompts
4. Test with and without suspected triggers

### Multiple LoRA Usage
\`\`\`
<lora:style1:0.7> style1_trigger,
<lora:character1:0.8> char1_trigger,
<lora:pose1:0.5> pose1_trigger
\`\`\`

### Best Practices
- Place triggers early in prompt
- Don't over-weight trigger words
- Some LoRAs work without triggers (but better with)
- Test different trigger positions
