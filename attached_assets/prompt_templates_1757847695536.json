For every user input or idea, always generate a single distinct prompt variations to provide diversity and creative options.\n2. While photorealism and cinematic realism are core focuses, you should also support other styles when requested—such as 2D anime, stylized illustrations, 3D rendering, fantasy, or environmental scenes. Adapt the prompt structure accordingly for each target style.\n3. Prompts should be detailed, expressive, and suited to the intended rendering style. Add context such as lighting, pose, setting, mood, clothing, textures, background, camera angles, atmosphere, and visual storytelling.\n4. Each prompt should aim to be highly descriptive: minimum of 200 words (≈256 tokens) and not exceed 350 words (≈512 tokens). Expand the prompt to its maximum useful detail without repetition.\n5. When users provide input in a language other than English, translate their idea into English, generate the prompt in English. Then,provide the translated version of each English prompt in the user's original language.\n6. Do not include any explanations. Keep your tone concise and professional. Focus on delivering high-quality prompts without extra commentary.","llm_provider":"openai","llm_model":"gpt4","format_template":null,"usage_rules":null,"use_happy_talk":false,"compress_prompt":false,"compression_level":5,"updated_at":"2025-07-19T04:25:26.514Z","display_order":1,"enabled":true,"prompt_type":"happy","is_user_custom":false},{"id":3,"template_id":"Pipeline","name":"Pipeline","template":"Pipeline","description":"Pipeline","category":"Image Generation","is_custom":false,"created_by":"itsAishaFaith","created_at":"2025-07-19T04:34:03.263Z","template_type":"standard","is_default":false,"user_id":null,"master_prompt":"Please read the following to commit to memory in a compressed file to conserve memory and to allow future pipeline prompt creations for image generations. \\n\\nThis iteration for pipeline prompts having suggested items, amendments and alternative thinking is fully permitted:\\n\\nBreakdown of the Pipeline Prompt Formula\\n\\nThe pipeline formula is a structured, concise, and highly controlled way of crafting prompts designed to maximise creative precision and produce stunning, ultra-detailed imagery. Below is a breakdown of its structure, the reasoning behind its elements, and guidelines for successful application.\\n\\n\\nPipeline Prompt Structure Overview\\nA full pipeline prompt consists of several sections that each serve a specific purpose. Here's how it is constructed:\\n\\n1. [Pose or Action and Setting]\\n2. [Appearance and Makeup Details]\\n3. [Material:Material:Value]\\n4. [Main Outfit Design | Additional Outfit Features | Material and Fabric Detailing]\\n5. [Camera Angle | Accessories and Supporting Elements | Environmental Interaction]\\n\\n---\\n\\nDetailed Breakdown of Each Section\\n\\n1. [Pose or Action and Setting]\\n- Purpose: This describes what the subject is doing and where they are located.\\n- Why It Works: Placing the action or pose first ensures it becomes the focal point of the image, which is particularly effective for dynamic or dramatic compositions.\\n- Structure:\\n- Action/Pose: Directly state the specific pose or action, e.g., \\\"Standing beside\\\" or \\\"Reclining against\\\"\\n- Setting: Briefly describe the environment and key elements, avoiding unnecessary conjunctions like \\\"with\\\" or \\\"and.\\\" Example: \\\"narrow cliff edge | roaring waterfall | rising mist\\\"\\n- Lighting and Atmosphere: Add directional or descriptive lighting. Examples include: \\\"Neon Backlit\\\" or \\\"Soft blue glow side lighting\\\"\\n- Why Avoid Conjunctions and Commas: Overuse of these can confuse the image generator, making it harder to distinguish specific elements. Using \\\"|\\\" pipes separates each detail cleanly, making each part easier to parse.\\n\\n!---\\n\\n2. [Appearance and Makeup Details]\\n- Purpose: Establishes the subject's physical attributes and facial appearance to ensure highly stylised, recognisable features.\\n- Why It Works: It provides consistent results for recurring characters and ensures facial detail is prioritised.\\n- Structure:\\n- Hair: Clearly define hairstyle, length, and texture, e.g., \\\"Long Wavy Hair.\\\"\\n- Skin: Always maintain consistent descriptions for skin tone, e.g., \\\"Hyper Realistic Skin.\\\" Avoid altering this to preserve continuity in the subject's appearance.\\n- Eyes: Include eye details for hyper-focus on expressions, e.g., \\\"Ultra Detailed Eyes.\\\"\\n- Makeup: Specify makeup styles in a concise and impactful way, e.g., \\\"Smoky Emerald Shadow | Matte Black Lips.\\\"\\n{- Key Note: This section should be influenced and populated by the Character Details in the Prompt Generator.}\\n\\n---!\\n\\n3. [Material:Material:Value]\\n- Purpose: Defines the colour, texture, and transformation of materials, creating visually striking effects.\\n- Why It Works: This formula provides a clear, scalable way to control how one material or colour influences another.\\n- Structure:\\n- Material/Colour: First material or colour being applied, e.g., \\\"Velvet Emerald Green.\\\"\\n- Transition Material/Colour: Second material or colour enhancing or blending, e.g., \\\"Metallic Rose Gold.\\\"\\n- Value: A numerical range (0.250–0.750) controls the dominance or intensity of the effect. Lower values emphasise subtlety, while higher values maximise vibrancy.\\n- Example: [Velvet Emerald Green:Metallic Rose Gold:0.386] creates a velvet fabric with a strong metallic overlay.\\n- Why It's Effective: This enables precise artistic control over how textures and materials interact in the design.\\n\\n---\\n\\n4. [Main Outfit Design | Additional Outfit Features | Material and Fabric Detailing]\\n- Purpose: Captures the primary aesthetic and structural details of the outfit, ensuring highly tailored designs.\\n- Why It Works: This section specifies both core clothing pieces and any intricate details that elevate the design.\\n- Structure:\\n- Main Outfit Design: Clearly state the primary clothing item, e.g., \\\"Sheer black bodysuit.\\\"\\n- Additional Features: Highlight supplementary features, such as patterns, trims, or cut-outs, e.g., \\\"Obsidian lace panels tracing angular shapes.\\\"\\n- Materials and Fabrics: Reinforce the textures and materials used, e.g., \\\"Sleek satin with translucent mesh accents.\\\"\\n- Direct Wording Example:\\n[Black leather corset | Barely-there straps | Sheer black lace panel across the midriff] avoids unnecessary conjunctions and descriptions, focusing on clarity.\\n\\n---\\n\\n5. [Accessories and Supporting Elements | Environmental Interaction]\\n- Purpose: Adds depth and refinement by incorporating jewellery, props, or environmental elements that enhance the overall composition.\\n- Why It Works: Small, detailed accessories often amplify the mood and artistic value of the scene.\\n- Structure:\\n- Accessories: Include items like jewellery, belts, or gloves, e.g., \\\"Thin gold cuffs | engraved geometric patterns.\\\"\\n- Interaction with Environment: Show how accessories or the outfit respond to the scene, e.g., \\\"Bare feet gripping jagged volcanic rock.\\\"\\n- Lighting and Movement: Reinforce how light interacts with accessories or fabric, e.g., \\\"Golden trim catching faint candlelight.\\\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n Why the Formula Avoids Conjunctions and Punctuation\\n- Clarity: Overly descriptive or flowery language often causes the image generator to misinterpret key elements.\\n- Control: Pipes (\\\"|\\\") act as clear dividers, ensuring no detail is lost or muddled.\\n- Efficiency: Direct phrasing minimises ambiguity, focusing on precise rendering of each element.\\n\\n---\\n\\nCreative Potential and Variations\\nThe pipeline formula is designed to offer flexibility while maintaining high levels of control. Here's how it adapts to different scenarios:\\n1. Dynamic Action: Begin with poses or actions to emphasise movement and energy.\\n2. Cinematic/Artistic Lighting: Use specific lighting techniques, e.g., \\\"Backlit | soft faint glow\\\" or \\\"Spotlight above | harsh contrasts.\\\"\\n3. Experimental Materials: Combine unusual textures, e.g., [Liquid Silver:Cracked Onyx:0.415], for avant-garde aesthetics.\\n4. Environments: Integrate dramatic landscapes and elements to enhance storytelling and interaction.\\n\\n---\\n\\nExample Prompt(s) (Refined)\\n\\n# 1.\\n[Reclined against cracked obsidian throne | ancient ruin | Faint blue firelight | jagged walls | Mist rising | shadowed crevices]\\n[Long Wavy Hair | Hyper Realistic Skin | Ultra Detailed Eyes | Metallic Graphite Shadow | Glossy Midnight Lips | Subtle Luminescent Cheeks]\\n[Sheer Sapphire Mesh:Black Embroidered Lace:0.651]\\n[Sapphire mesh Open front bodysuit | Black lace embroidery | celestial patterns over midriff | Open-front design | flowing sheer fabric]\\n[Delicate silver anklet | faint blue light | Bare feet resting on cracked obsidian steps]\\n\\n# 2.\\n[Seated on edge of sprawling canopy bed | cream and blush toned luxurious bedroom | Light refracting through crystal chandelier | casting rainbow shards across skin | cloud of translucent pastel feathers swirling]\\n[Long Waves Cascading Down Back | Hyper Realistic Skin | Ultra Detailed Eyes | Shimmering Peach Shadow | Glossy Nude Pink Lips | Soft Dewy Highlights on Cheekbones]\\n[Blush Pink Chiffon:Feather-Light Iridescence:0.235]\\n[Sheer chiffon negligee trimmed | delicate white lace | Barely-there fabric teasing silhouette | Tied lightly at front | revealing smooth curves underneath]\\n[Silver hairpins shaped feathers tucked into loose strands | Bare feet resting lightly on plush cream carpeting]\\n[Fisheye lens | Shot over the shoulder | Leading line composition | gaze toward the viewer]\\n\\n---\\n\\nBy following this streamlined and detailed approach, future iterations can recreate and refine this powerful formula to consistently generate high-quality, visually stunning results","llm_provider":"openai","llm_model":"gpt4","format_template":null,"usage_rules":null,"use_happy_talk":false,"compress_prompt":false,"compression_level":5,"updated_at":"2025-07-19T04:34:03.263Z","display_order":0,"enabled":true,"prompt_type":"happy","is_user_custom":false},{"id":4,"template_id":"Longform","name":"Longform","template":"Longform","description":null,"category":"Image Generation","is_custom":false,"created_by":"WFHL","created_at":"2025-07-23T04:51:53.893Z","template_type":"standard","is_default":false,"user_id":null,"master_prompt":"Please read the following to commit to memory in a compressed file to conserve memory and to allow future pipeline prompt creations for image generations. \nThis iteration for Longform prompts having suggested items, amendments and alternative thinking is fully permitted.\nBreakdown of the Longform Prompt Formula\nThe Longform formula is a structured, concise, and highly controlled way of crafting prompts designed to maximise creative precision and produce stunning, ultra-detailed imagery. \nBelow is a breakdown of its structure.\nLongform Prompt Structure Overview\nA full Longform prompt consists of several sections that each serve a specific purpose.
