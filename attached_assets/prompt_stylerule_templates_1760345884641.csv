Here's how it is constructed:\n\n1. [Pose or Action and Setting]\n2. [Appearance and Makeup Details]\n3. [Material:Material:Value]\n4. [Main Outfit Design | Additional Outfit Features | Material and Fabric Detailing]\n5. [Camera Angle | Accessories and Supporting Elements | Environmental Interaction]\n\n---\n\nDetailed Breakdown of Each Section\n\n1. [Pose or Action and Setting]\n- Purpose: This describes what the subject is doing and where they are located.\n- Why It Works: Placing the action or pose first ensures it becomes the focal point of the image, which is particularly effective for dynamic or dramatic compositions.\n- Structure:\n- Action/Pose: Directly state the specific pose or action, e.g., \""Standing beside\"" or \""Reclining against\""\n- Setting: Briefly describe the environment and key elements, avoiding unnecessary conjunctions like \""with\"" or \""and.\"" Example: \""narrow cliff edge | roaring waterfall | rising mist\""\n- Lighting and Atmosphere: Add directional or descriptive lighting. Examples include: \""Neon Backlit\"" or \""Soft blue glow side lighting\""\n- Why Avoid Conjunctions and Commas: Overuse of these can confuse the image generator, making it harder to distinguish specific elements. Using \""|\"" pipes separates each detail cleanly, making each part easier to parse.\n\n!---\n\n2. [Appearance and Makeup Details]\n- Purpose: Establishes the subject's physical attributes and facial appearance to ensure highly stylised, recognisable features.\n- Why It Works: It provides consistent results for recurring characters and ensures facial detail is prioritised.\n- Structure:\n- Hair: Clearly define hairstyle, length, and texture, e.g., \""Long Wavy Hair.\""\n- Skin: Always maintain consistent descriptions for skin tone, e.g., \""Hyper Realistic Skin.\"" Avoid altering this to preserve continuity in the subject's appearance.\n- Eyes: Include eye details for hyper-focus on expressions, e.g., \""Ultra Detailed Eyes.\""\n- Makeup: Specify makeup styles in a concise and impactful way, e.g., \""Smoky Emerald Shadow | Matte Black Lips.\""\n{- Key Note: This section should be influenced and populated by the Character Details in the Prompt Generator.}\n\n---!\n\n3. [Material:Material:Value]\n- Purpose: Defines the colour, texture, and transformation of materials, creating visually striking effects.\n- Why It Works: This formula provides a clear, scalable way to control how one material or colour influences another.\n- Structure:\n- Material/Colour: First material or colour being applied, e.g., \""Velvet Emerald Green.\""\n- Transition Material/Colour: Second material or colour enhancing or blending, e.g., \""Metallic Rose Gold.\""\n- Value: A numerical range (0.250–0.750) controls the dominance or intensity of the effect. Lower values emphasise subtlety, while higher values maximise vibrancy.\n- Example: [Velvet Emerald Green:Metallic Rose Gold:0.386] creates a velvet fabric with a strong metallic overlay.\n- Why It's Effective: This enables precise artistic control over how textures and materials interact in the design.\n\n---\n\n4.

[Accessories and Supporting Elements | Environmental Interaction]\n- Purpose: Adds depth and refinement by incorporating jewellery, props, or environmental elements that enhance the overall composition.\n- Why It Works: Small, detailed accessories often amplify the mood and artistic value of the scene.\n- Structure:\n- Accessories: Include items like jewellery, belts, or gloves, e.g., \""Thin gold cuffs | engraved geometric patterns.\""\n- Interaction with Environment: Show how accessories or the outfit respond to the scene, e.g., \""Bare feet gripping jagged volcanic rock.\""\n- Lighting and Movement: Reinforce how light interacts with accessories or fabric, e.g., \""Golden trim catching faint candlelight.\""\n\n---\n\n Why the Formula Avoids Conjunctions and Punctuation\n- Clarity: Overly descriptive or flowery language often causes the image generator to misinterpret key elements.\n- Control: Pipes (\""|\"") act as clear dividers, ensuring no detail is lost or muddled.\n- Efficiency: Direct phrasing minimises ambiguity, focusing on precise rendering of each element.\n\n---\n\nCreative Potential and Variations\nThe pipeline formula is designed to offer flexibility while maintaining high levels of control.
